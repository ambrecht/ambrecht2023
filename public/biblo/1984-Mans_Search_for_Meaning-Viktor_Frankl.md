## Description

"Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor E. Frankl is a profound narrative of his
experiences in Nazi death camps and the development of logotherapy, his
psychotherapeutic method. Frankl's work teaches us about the human quest for
meaning and the power of spiritual survival in the face of utter desolation.
