## Description

"Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting," written by Robert McKee and published in 1997, has emerged as a seminal guidebook in the realms of film and TV writing. Originating as a live seminar at the University of Southern California in the 1980s, McKee's work delved into the depths of screenwriting, discussing various aspects such as the interplay between story structure, plot, and character, and the importance of character in defining plot and theme. The book also explores screenwriting in relation to other art forms, emphasizing the creation of empathy for characters and the use of conflict to build a convincing story world【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】【19†source】【20†source】【21†source】【22†source】.
